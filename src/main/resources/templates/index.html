            <p>Hi there! I'm Dominic - a high school student based in Canada.</p>

            <p>I have a strong interest in system administration, homelabbing, and I'm currently diving into software engineering, focusing on learning Java. 
            You can check out some of my projects on <a th:href="@{/oss}">my open source page</a>.</p>

            <p>I'm currently working as a Technical Content Editor at 
                <a href="https://goauthentik.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authentik Security</a>, 
                where I handle quality assurance, squash a few bugs here and there, and contribute to documentation.</p>

            <p>You can also find me on GitHub:
