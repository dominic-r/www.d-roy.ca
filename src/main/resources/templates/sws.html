            <h1>SDKO Web Services (SWS)</h1>
            <p>SDKO Web Services (SWS) is my personal web services platform for my homelab and personal projects.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="infrastructure">
            <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>My services are powered by servers located in Canadian data centers. Because I'm Canadian and live in Montreal, it wouldn't make sense to have infrastructure in US-West or other distant regions.</p>
            
            <p>All servers are hosted on one of the following providers, whose terms and privacy policies also apply:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Canadian regions only</li>
                <li>Linode - Canadian data centers</li>
                <li>OVH - Canadian data centers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>External Gateway Servers</h3>
            <p>The following servers handle external traffic:</p>
            
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>IPv4</th>
                        <th>IPv6</th>
                        <th>Provider</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>149.56.142.15</code></td>
                        <td><code>2607:5300:201:3100::7d00</code></td>
                        <td>OVH</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>172.105.21.38</code></td>
                        <td><code>2600:3c04::f03c:95ff:fe72:5f0c</code></td>
                        <td>Linode</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>99.79.69.51</code></td>
                        <td><code>2600:1f11:dab:7b01:8ea3:f673:231d:b8d6</code></td>
                        <td>AWS</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <h3>Internal Network</h3>
            <p>Several additional servers are part of the internal network infrastructure. For security reasons, their IPs and specifications are not publicly listed.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="logging">
            <h2>Logging and Data Retention</h2>
            <p>I maintain minimal logging practices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Logs are stored and forwarded to a central logging server where they are analyzed and stored for a maximum of 30 days</li>
                <li>No personal information is collected beyond what is necessary for service operation</li>
                <li>All logs are stored exclusively on Canadian servers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Security Measures</h3>
            <p>I implement appropriate security measures for SWS, including encryption, regular updates, and industry standard practices. For security reasons, I don't publicly list all measures in detail.</p>
